In this talk, Kyri is going to take you Beyond the Tutorial into the world of production code, planning, pitfalls, and big ideas in the Machine Learning space. She will explore the most important things to know and remember the tutorials never tell you, what Machine Learning looks like in an increasingly mobile world, and where this all applies in real everyday life."

          "description": "Every engineer has great intentions when diving into a codebase. You want to make the code beautiful, easy to read, and modular. However as time passes and new feature and quick bug fixes are put in, somehow your android codebase turned into a mess of multiple levels of inheritance of views and fragments and you're stuck wondering how you ended up here in the first place.\n\nIn my talk I will share with you common poor patterns that every developer first makes when developing in android and the alternative architecture patterns to ensuring clean code. We will talk about listeners, event driven paradigms and clean architecture."
